This is a fabricjs example.

FabricJS primaly just acts upon a canvas.
So there is not much html going on.

To make the javascript typed we will use typescript.

Appex can then translate this typescript into a json schema.
So for this type we want a typescript interface declaration.

For now it is just for configuration. 
I can also imagine you will want to expose the useful 
public methods so creating new components can be done visually.
But this is for later use.

Note that we will be describing this component, we will
not be describing the entire fabricjs. Just the interface
for this component. 

These components should be as configurable as possible and
should be really good at their purpose.

When we use the component and configure it, we do not want
to touch the javascript itself.
